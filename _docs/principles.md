## Principles

## Numero Uno
Our primary principle is to work as a team to deliver the best outcomes for the business.

## Transparency
We combine face to face and verbal communcation with individual focus and use tools such as Slack, Trello, and GitHub to communicate openly within a project, within Axurcio, and publicly.

## Honesty
While we are considerate of people's feelings and opinions, we cannot let those concerns get in the way of getting the right outcome for the business and the success of our work. We'd rather be too honest than too polite.

## Trust
Our standards are very high, and bringing on a new team member requires a "yes" from everyone who participated in the interview process. Therefore, we expect the best from each other, give each other the benefit of the doubt, and encourage each other to take initiative to improve ourselves to improve my contribution to the team and the company.

## Continuous Improvement
We recognize that we can always be better. Therefore, we have strong opinions, loosely held, and take initiative to improve ourselves, the company, and our community. We are proponents of the Agile manifesto
