## Our Competencies

**Cloud Native Architecture & Development**

Cloud-native architecture fully takes advantage of the distributed, scalable, flexible nature of the public cloud to maximise your focus on writing code, creating business value and keeping customers happy.

**DevOps**

DevOps is a set of practices that works to automate and integrate the processes between software development and IT teams, so they can build, test, and release software faster and more reliably.

**Application Innovation & Modernisation**

We target the below strategies
- ~~Lift and Shift~~
- Refactor 
- Replatform
- Rebuild
- Replace

**Integration**

Integration platform as a service (iPaaS) is a platform for building and deploying integrations within the cloud and between the cloud and enterprise. With iPaaS, users can develop integration flows that connect applications residing in the cloud or on-premises and then deploy them without installing or managing any hardware or middleware.

Our tool of choice is [Azure Integration Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/product-categories/integration/). 

**Web/Mobile/DesktopApplications**

From PWA/Native mobile apps to web and desktop apps, we custom build applications using a variety of languages, frameworks and toolsets.
