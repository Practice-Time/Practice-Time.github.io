## Goal 

**Be successful as a practice and continue to grow the team** 

## Our ask

*  If you do work for a project (including research) bill to the project.  
*  Do your best to be as billable as possible. If you have a project and it’s blocked try and find things to do that may help you later. E.g. waiting for a design workshop? Ask yourself the following:   
• Can I do current state/document review?  
• Can I create a pre-requisites list?  
• What are the deliverables we need to produce?
• Can I create the draft design? Test plan? As-built? Handover documentation? Implementation plan? Prep ARM templates/code? Establish the tools and operating environment/source control? Test deployments?    

Proactively try and find things to do on a project and let me and the project manager know once you have exhausted all options.    

* If you finish something under the allocated time, what more can you do? Enhance the design? Create some work instructions? Try and add additional value where you are ahead of time.    
   
* _Always_ look for new opportunities in existing engagements. Hear about something that we could deliver? Set up a workshop, rope in someone else and figure out what it is they want. This creates new pipeline for us. Also consider the other practices and understanding what they do, is there an opportunity for them? All are relevant!   

## Establish an open, collaborative and continually improving culture in the team.

**Be successful as a practice and continue to grow the team**

## Our ask
* Go out of your way to try and help others and make everyone feel comfortable and a member of the team straight away  
* Don’t be afraid to ask for help!  
* Use your downtime to contribute to practice IP, for example.  
    • Create new document templates we can re-use 
    • Start contributing to GitHub and especially Azure Foundations/Landing Zones (check out setup guide in OneNote to make sure you have VSCode setup and connected to the repo’s – Thanks to Ramu for setting this up!).   
        - Record issues    
        - Fix issues   
        - Update wiki’s    
* Come to me with your ideas on how we can improve or any ideas you have for offerings or go to market.   
* Lean on your career coach and make sure you are clear with your goals and what you want to work towards.    
* Career coaches, make sure you are capturing these goals and letting me know (using Connections 1-1 is a good idea). I will look for follow up sessions with coaches/coaches to map out a plan and look at focus areas.    
* Come to me with anything!    
* Think about return to the office. It’s hard to build culture online and Fridays are great. I encourage you all to look for opportunities to do a day or two extra in the office per week/fortnight while still working flexibly where needed.    


## Goal 

**Be technically excellent and recognised as thought leaders in the market**

## Our ask

* Focus on certification. This helps us win more work.  

* Start blogging, there is a guide on our GitHub! Posts show up here:

 Repo is here:

Doesn’t need to be war and peace. Created a handy script that solved a problem? Issue that you solved? Post about it  
Feel free to do the bigger posts and break them up into multiple parts.  

* Learn from and shadow others, try and diversify your skillsets and get more exposure. Heard someone is working on something interesting? Ask them to explain it to you on a whiteboard or show you the environment. Use this chance to learn and research to improve your skills.  

* Reflect on all of your work and look for opportunities to grow or do better next time from both a technical or engagement perspective. Meeting went poorly? Why? What will you do next time to prevent that?
