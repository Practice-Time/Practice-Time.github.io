Communication
=============

Our **main internal communication channels** are:

* Team call every week.  Just casual with all welcome.  Questions: _How are you going out of 5, What are you working on?  All OK?_
* Monthly Lean Coffee to discuss / address issues
* [Back 2 base](/docs/back-2-base.html).
* [Team](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3a657359b71bab4578a0e1aece861402c6%40thread.skype/conversations?groupId=925069ba-3641-4307-b32f-ee6ad379a00b&tenantId=6c637512-c417-4e78-9d62-b61258e4b619) for chat

> Most decisions are made, and most problems solved, in one of the above forums.
