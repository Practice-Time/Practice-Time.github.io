Consulting Tips
============

1. Redirect your client email to your work email (setup a folder) so you dont miss emails they send you  
2. Use a Chrome Profile to interact with their web based systems. This will ensure your cookies/login information does not get mixed up and cause authentication issues  
3. Use Power Automate to sync outlook calendar events   
4. If you are not assigned to the client - mark yourself as out of office in their calendar system  


# Some General Advice!

## When working with your client, start from where they are now.

Understand your clientâ€™s perspective on their issues, including what they have tried, what
has worked, what has not worked and what they think should be done now. It is better to go
slower with your client than faster without them. 

## Come to the project with a basic consultation framework in mind

Early in a project, the major purpose of the framework can be used as a common frame of
reference when talking about the project goals, methods, evaluation and learning. Be willing
to modify that framework as you and your client work together. 


 ## Your value is in the flow of the process, not in the details of the project. 

 Your client will value you if both of you continue to work together in a process that is
collaborative, well understood, communicated to all and focused on results. 

## It is up to your client to use your advice or not

This is sometimes one of the hardest principles for new consultants to accept. It helps if you
remember that people learn only what they are ready to learn. 

## Do not take it personal

Often your client struggles with an issue, in part, because of their role in the issue. They
may not want to change themselves and might resist your attempts to help them. In those
instances, remember that those responses are their choices, not yours.
