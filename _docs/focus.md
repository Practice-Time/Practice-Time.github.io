Why Focus?
-----------------------------------

Focus time is where we invest in ourselves, our teammates and our practice. Investing is how we grow :)

Use this time to 

-   learn and evaluate new technology
-   shadow someone you want to learn from / teach someone who wants to learn
-   earn certifications to help establish our competence in our clients eyes
-   blog/speak/organise to help the community

## When

We try to target every 2nd Friday of the month (last Friday in the office together).  

This time is flexible given client and personal commitments.  The goal here is to get a team heartbeat where we know we can work together.
## Your commitment

- We write down each individuals goals and share them internally with the team 
- We review these goals every 3 months
- You will be asked to present at the half yearly back to base on how well you did to achieve your stated goals


## Rules

As this is a luxury we have this our practice there are rules around it  

**The day is only granted when you are billing 9 days in a fortnight billing cycle.**

So if you are _sick_, have _leave_ or there is a _public holiday_ , we expect you to bill to the client for your focus day or use the appropriate other billing codes that apply to your circumstances.
