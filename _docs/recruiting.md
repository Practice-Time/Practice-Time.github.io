Hire awesome people, or don't hire at all
-----------------------------------------

Recruitment is crucial - the model only works as long as we are super-picky about who we bring in. If we start getting below-par consultants, the positive loops above could easily turn into negative loops (bad consultants =&gt; disappointed customers =&gt; bad reputation =&gt; the best consultants leave =&gt; etc).

We'd rather grow too slow than too fast, so we pretty much only hire people that we already know are awesome. We're a bit lazy in that sense, and grateful that our hire can be vouched for by multiple team-mates :o)

Don't steal people from clients!
--------------------------------

One golden rule as a consultant is to never ever hire a co-worker from a client. Managers obviously don't want consultants to steal their employees, so we won't recruit a candidate until after both the candidate and the consultant have left the place where they worked together. Sometimes years after.

An awesome person is worth waiting for.

What kind of people do fit at CAI?
------------------------------------

Most people who end up at CAI were previously consultants (or were heading in that direction). Typical personality traits:

-   **Self-confident** - they know that they are highly skilled and in high demand.
-   **Social** - they like to maintain a strong network and collaborate with people. Some of us are introverts, but still kind of social :o)
-   **Curious** - want to learn new things, every day. Love geeking out on new technologies, processes, etc.
-   **Generous** - like to share what they learn, not primarily for profit but because it's fun and rewarding in itself.
-   **Responsible** - they're used to taking responsibility for their own goals and actions, and don't wait for others to tell them what to do or solve their problems.
