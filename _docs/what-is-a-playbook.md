What is this playbook?
======================

Our playbook outlines how we work together to win work, design and build software, manage projects, and run our practice.

It is a living document that everyone can edit and improve a private GitHub repo.

In short, a playbook is the "culture we adopt for consultants in the practice" :o)

## Our Culture

A culture is "the way a community or organization does things". It is the combined set of behaviours and beliefs, norms and values, artifacts and institutions that organize how the set of people interact and work together. It is the basic operating system for collective being.

Culture is often implicit rather than explicit. It is usually undocumented, unlike, say, the way to prepare an invoice or to set up a laptop. This is our attempt to document our culture, to make it more explicit and therefore to make it easier to navigate, participate in and contribute to, especially for newcomers.

**Ontology**

All culture is rooted in an (implicit) ontology: a set of beliefs about "being", that is, how human beings are and how they operate.

**Ontogeny**

Linked to an ontology is an ontogeny: a belief about how we got to be the way we are and how that can change (or "transform").

Ontogeny is not about how we acquire knowledge or learn new skills. It is focused on how we come to "be" and our "ways of being" -- i.e. personality, attitudes, will and consciousness.
