Why this model works (for us)
=============================

* We are remote and distributed => need to self-manage, need to (over-)communicate esp re projects, clients, integrity
* We have team-mates and clients from many different nationalities and cultures => hence the need for explicit communication
* Performance and quality are important => integrity and coachability as well as a base of intelligence and ability to learn


The key thing is the two loops - positive feedback cycles that keep getting stronger and stronger.

Positive feedback loops
-----------------------

**Left loop:**

1. Competent & motivated consultants do a better job, which leads to happy customers.
2. Happy customers give us a good reputation.
3. Good reputation increases our motivation further & attracts new competent people to our company.
4. GOTO 1

**Right loop:**

1. Competent & motivated consultants do a better job, which leads to happy customers.
2. More and happier customers leads to higher profit.
3. Higher profit means people can afford to spend time learning new things (instead of trying to make every hour customer-debitable), and feel more safe doing so.
4. Taking time to explore and learn new things together makes us more motivated and more competent!
5. GOTO 1

Measure and manage motivation. Profit is just a side effect.
------------------------------------------------------------

The key point is that we focus on keeping ourselves and our customers happy, not profit or growth. Good reputation and profit are simply side effects of keeping ourselves and our customers happy.
